Readme For The project – WanderTrails

________________________________________
🌍 WanderTrails — AI-Powered Travel Planner & Discovery Platform
WanderTrails is an AI-driven travel planning web application designed to simplify trip discovery, itinerary creation,and travel decision-making.
The project focuses on experience-first planning, combining AI insights with real-world travel data and external booking platforms.
This project was built as a learning-first, exploratory full-stack project during my BTech 1st year, with an emphasis on modern web architecture and AI integration.

✨ Features Implemented
🤖 AI-Powered Core
•	AI chatbot for travel-related queries
•	AI-based itinerary planner based on:
o	Trip duration
o	Mood / travel style
•	AI trip suggester that provides:
o	Trending destinations
o	Upcoming events
o	Weather & temperature
o	Overall “vibe” of the destination
•	All AI features powered using Gemini
________________________________________
🧭 Travel Planning

o	Flights
o	Trains
o	Buses
o	Hotels
•	Multi-currency support:
o	USD
o	INR
o	Local currency (auto-detected, e.g. Yen for Japan)
________________________________________
🔐 Authentication
•	Login & signup system
•	Fully functional and tested in local development
________________________________________
🔗 External Integrations

🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
•	Backend: Next.js API Routes (serverless architecture)
•	AI: Gemini API
•	Auth: Custom API-based authentication (local)
•	Deployment: Vercel (frontend)
________________________________________
⚠️ Current Limitation (Transparent Note)
While the application works correctly in local development, the deployed version currently faces a backend rendering / serverless deployment issue related to authentication and API execution on Vercel.
•	✅ Authentication works locally
•	❌ Production deployment faces backend rendering constraints
•	📹 A working demo video & screenshots are provided to demonstrate full functionality
This issue is infrastructure-related, not a feature or logic limitation, and will be addressed as backend & deployment knowledge deepens.
________________________________________
🔮 Future Scope
•	Fully deployed backend with stable authentication
•	Real-time pricing via third-party APIs
•	User profiles & saved trips
•	Personalized recommendations
•	Community-shared itineraries
•	Performance optimization & analytics
•	Progressive Web App (PWA) support
________________________________________
🤝 Open Source & Collaboration
This project is open-sourced.
Anyone is welcome to:
•	Explore the code
•	Extend features
•	Collaborate
•	Build independently on top of it

📌 Final Note
WanderTrails represents a learning milestone, not a finished product.
The goal was to explore system design, AI integration, and modern web development — and that goal has been achieved.
